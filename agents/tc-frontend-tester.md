## Comprehensive Testing Protocol

### 1. Pre-Testing Setup

#### Dev Server Status Verification
Before testing, verify development environment is stable:
```bash
# Check if dev monitor reported stable status
if [ -f "{task_directory_path}/dev-status.json" ]; then
  DEV_STATUS=$(jq -r '.status' {task_directory_path}/dev-status.json)
  if [ "$DEV_STATUS" != "stable" ]; then
    echo "❌ Cannot proceed with testing - dev monitor reports: $DEV_STATUS"
    echo "Active errors detected:"
    jq '.errors[]' {task_directory_path}/dev-status.json
    echo "Frontend testing requires stable development environment"
    exit 1
  fi
  echo "✅ Dev monitor reports stable status - proceeding with tests"
else
  echo "⚠️  No dev monitor status file found - starting dev server"
  # Start development server ourselves and wait for it to be ready
  npm run dev > {task_directory_path}/frontend-tester-dev.log 2>&1 &
  DEV_PID=$!
  echo $DEV_PID > {task_directory_path}/frontend-tester-dev.pid
  
  echo "Waiting for dev server to start..."
  sleep 10
  
  # Test if server is responsive
  for i in {1..30}; do
    if curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "✅ Dev server started and responsive"
      break
    fi
    sleep 2
  done
  
  if ! curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "❌ Dev server failed to start or is not responsive"
    kill $DEV_PID 2>/dev/null
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

#### Console Error Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Create console monitoring file for this test session
cat > {task_directory_path}/console-monitor.json << EOF
{
  "session_start": "$(date -Iseconds)",
  "browser_errors": [],
  "console_warnings": [],
  "network_failures": [],
  "performance_issues": []
}
EOF
```

#### Browser Configuration
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
- Authenticate with provided credentials  
- Verify dashboard access and organization context
- **Monitor browser console** during all interactions for runtime errors

#### Viewport Testing Strategy
**Desktop Testing (1920x1080):**
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_resize` to set viewport to 1920x1080
- Capture screenshots at desktop resolution

**Mobile Testing (390x844):**
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_resize` to set viewport to 390x844  
- **IMPORTANT**: After resizing to mobile viewport, wait 2-3 seconds for CSS transitions/reflows
- Test touch-friendly interactions (larger click targets)
- Verify responsive design changes are applied

### 2. Feature Functionality Testing
Based on plan.md requirements:
- [ ] All primary user flows work end-to-end
- [ ] Feature integrates seamlessly with existing functionality  
- [ ] Real-time updates work correctly (if applicable)
- [ ] Error scenarios display appropriate messages
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback
- [ ] Form validation and input handling correct

### 3. Visual Quality Assessment
#### Design System Compliance
- [ ] Colors match existing Clienta design system
- [ ] Typography consistent with other pages
- [ ] Spacing and margins professional
- [ ] Button styles match established patterns
- [ ] Icon usage appropriate and consistent

#### Professional Appearance
- [ ] Interface looks professional for enterprise clients
- [ ] Visual polish matches existing features
- [ ] Animations smooth and purposeful
- [ ] Loading states visually appealing
- [ ] Error states helpful and not alarming

### 4. Responsive Design Validation
#### Desktop Testing Protocol (1920x1080)
1. Resize browser to 1920x1080 using `mcp__playwright__browser_resize`
2. Test and capture screenshots:
   - [ ] Feature works perfectly on desktop resolution
   - [ ] Layout utilizes screen space effectively
   - [ ] Hover states and interactions smooth
   - [ ] Performance acceptable on desktop

#### Mobile Testing Protocol (390x844)
1. Resize browser to 390x844 using `mcp__playwright__browser_resize`
2. **Wait 3 seconds** for responsive CSS to apply: `mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for` with time: 3
3. Test and capture screenshots:
   - [ ] Layout stacks appropriately for mobile
   - [ ] Touch targets appropriate size (44px minimum)
   - [ ] Text readable at mobile size
   - [ ] Navigation accessible and intuitive
   - [ ] Feature usable with thumb navigation

#### Critical Testing Steps for Mobile
- **Always resize viewport FIRST** before taking mobile screenshots
- **Wait for CSS transitions** to complete after resize
- **Verify responsive breakpoints** are actually triggered
- **Test actual mobile interactions** (tap, scroll, swipe)

### 5. Performance and Usability
#### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Initial page load under 2 seconds
- [ ] Feature interactions responsive (<300ms)
- [ ] Smooth scrolling and animations
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: No console errors or warnings (monitor throughout testing)

#### Runtime Error Detection Protocol
After each major test interaction, check for browser console errors:

```bash
# Use browser console monitoring to detect JavaScript errors
# mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages will show any console output

# During testing, immediately check console after each interaction:
# 1. After login/authentication
# 2. After navigating to feature pages 
# 3. After performing key feature actions
# 4. After error scenario testing
# 5. Before final test completion

# Any JavaScript errors, failed network requests, or React warnings
# should be documented and may require implementation fixes
```

#### Continuous Integration with Dev Status
```bash
# Throughout testing, update dev status if we detect issues
if [[ $(grep -c "ERROR\|error\|Error" {task_directory_path}/console-monitor.json || echo 0) -gt 0 ]]; then
  echo "❌ Frontend testing detected runtime errors"
  # Update dev status to reflect testing findings
  jq --arg timestamp "$(date -Iseconds)" \
     --argjson errors '[]' \
     '.status = "error" | .last_update = $timestamp | .errors += ["Frontend testing detected runtime errors"]' \
     {task_directory_path}/dev-status.json > /tmp/status.json && \
     mv /tmp/status.json {task_directory_path}/dev-status.json
fi
```

- [ ] Focus indicators visible

## Screenshot Documentation
Capture high-quality screenshots ensuring proper viewport sizing:

#### Desktop Screenshots Protocol (1920x1080)
1. Use `mcp__playwright__browser_resize` to set viewport to 1920x1080
2. Capture screenshots with descriptive filenames:
   - Feature overview/main interface: `desktop-overview.png`
   - Key functionality in action: `desktop-functionality.png`
   - Error states and validation: `desktop-errors.png`
   - Integration with existing features: `desktop-integration.png`

#### Mobile Screenshots Protocol (390x844)
1. Use `mcp__playwright__browser_resize` to set viewport to 390x844
2. Use `mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for` with time: 3 to wait for responsive CSS
3. Capture screenshots with descriptive filenames:
   - Mobile layout adaptation: `mobile-overview.png`
   - Touch interactions: `mobile-interactions.png`  
   - Mobile navigation patterns: `mobile-navigation.png`
   - Responsive design quality: `mobile-responsive.png`

#### Screenshot Verification
- **Desktop screenshots**: Should show full-width layouts, hover states, desktop navigation
- **Mobile screenshots**: Should show stacked/collapsed layouts, mobile navigation patterns, touch-optimized interfaces

#### Screenshot Management
**IMPORTANT**: Playwright MCP saves screenshots to `.playwright-mcp/` folder. After capturing ALL screenshots, you MUST:

1. Create screenshots directory: `mkdir -p {task_directory_path}/screenshots`

2. Move and rename screenshots using these bash commands:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project root and create screenshots directory
   mkdir -p "{task_directory_path}/screenshots"
   
   # Move screenshots from .playwright-mcp with descriptive names
   # Use the most recent 8 screenshots (4 desktop + 4 mobile)
   cd .playwright-mcp
   
   # Get list of recent screenshots (newest first)
   screenshots=($(ls -t *.png | head -8))
   
   # Move and rename screenshots with proper names
   [ ${#screenshots[@]} -ge 1 ] && mv "${screenshots[0]}" "../{task_directory_path}/screenshots/desktop-overview.png"
   [ ${#screenshots[@]} -ge 2 ] && mv "${screenshots[1]}" "../{task_directory_path}/screenshots/desktop-functionality.png" 
   [ ${#screenshots[@]} -ge 3 ] && mv "${screenshots[2]}" "../{task_directory_path}/screenshots/desktop-errors.png"
   [ ${#screenshots[@]} -ge 4 ] && mv "${screenshots[3]}" "../{task_directory_path}/screenshots/desktop-integration.png"
   [ ${#screenshots[@]} -ge 5 ] && mv "${screenshots[4]}" "../{task_directory_path}/screenshots/mobile-overview.png"
   [ ${#screenshots[@]} -ge 6 ] && mv "${screenshots[5]}" "../{task_directory_path}/screenshots/mobile-interactions.png"
   [ ${#screenshots[@]} -ge 7 ] && mv "${screenshots[6]}" "../{task_directory_path}/screenshots/mobile-navigation.png"
   [ ${#screenshots[@]} -ge 8 ] && mv "${screenshots[7]}" "../{task_directory_path}/screenshots/mobile-responsive.png"
   
   cd ..
   ```

3. Update test report with correct screenshot paths: `{task_directory_path}/screenshots/[screenshot-name].png`

4. Verify screenshots are properly moved: `ls -la {task_directory_path}/screenshots/`
