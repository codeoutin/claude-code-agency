# Claude Code Task Completion System

A multi-agent orchestration system that automates feature implementation with production-ready quality standards.

## ðŸš€ Personal Motivation

*From the creator:*

I've spent whole weekends coding huge tasks with AI. Starting with Chats (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini), to Cursor, to Claude Code. I ran often into the limitations of AI coding agents and I'm always trying to optimize my prompts.

With the introduction of Sub Agents and MCP servers, I finally found a workflow for complex tasks to have them implemented with a high quality standard that suits my projects.

These commands can run for hours and you will likely run into limitations if you are not on a Max Plan of Claude.

I share this workflow because I started out with publicly available agent descriptions, MCP server configurations and other information on GitHub and Reddit too and want to open this workflow for discussion and further improvements.

I often had issues where i closed the Terminal and picking up the task again would take a long time and introduce new errors and the AI would forget my previous concerns. The agents will document their progress and the Terminal will stay clean.

This command chain is using various MCP servers that are optional but highly recommended. My subscriptions are Claude on the 100 USD plan and ChatGPT on the 20 USD plan and I often run this command parallel to develop 3-4 features at once. I am using auto-accept to almost fully automate the process of development.

## Quick Start

### One-Line Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeoutin/claude-code-agency/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or [**download install.sh**](install.sh) and run: `./install.sh`

### Manual Setup

The fastest way to set up the task completion system in your project:

#### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup) installed and configured
- Anthropic account (Pro/Max plan recommended for complex tasks)
- Git for version control

#### Quick Setup with Claude Code's Built-in Init

1. **Navigate to your project directory**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Initialize with Claude Code and install task completion system**
   ```bash
   # Initialize Claude Code in your project
   claude
   /init
   
   # Clone the task completion system
   git clone https://github.com/codeoutin/claude-code-agency.git temp-claude-agency
   
   # Copy the task completion components
   cp temp-claude-agency/examples/settings.json .claude/settings.json
   cp temp-claude-agency/examples/settings.local.json .claude/settings.local.json
   cp -r temp-claude-agency/agents .claude/
   cp -r temp-claude-agency/commands .claude/
   cp -r temp-claude-agency/examples .
   cp -r temp-claude-agency/docs .
   
   # Clean up
   rm -rf temp-claude-agency
   ```

3. **Customize Your Setup**
   
   **a. Set up project templates (AI-assisted)**
   ```bash
   # Copy the templates
   cp examples/PROJECT_STATUS.md .
   cp examples/PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md .
   
   # Use Claude Code to customize them for your project
   claude "Please customize PROJECT_STATUS.md and PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md for my project. Replace all placeholder content with details specific to my codebase and project goals."
   ```
   
   **b. Configure agent settings**
   ```bash
   # Customize test credentials
   claude "Update .claude/agents/tc-frontend-tester.md with my email: your-email@example.com"
   
   # Update technology stack info
   claude "Update .claude/agents/tc-codex-critic.md with my tech stack details based on my package.json and codebase"
   ```
   
   **c. Set up local permissions (optional)**
   ```bash
   cp examples/settings.local.json .claude/settings.local.json
   # Edit for any project-specific permissions you need
   ```

4. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Test the task completion commands
   claude-code /task_easy "Test the task completion system setup"
   ```


#### File Structure After Installation

```

```

#### Troubleshooting Manual Installation

**Commands not found:**
- Verify files are in `.claude/commands/` or `commands/` directory
- Check that Claude Code CLI is properly installed
- Try restarting your terminal

**MCP servers not working:**
- Review `docs/MCP_SERVERS.md` for MCP server setup
- Check that required MCP servers are installed and configured
- Verify `.claude/settings.json` has correct MCP server references

**Agents not accessible:**
- Ensure agent files are in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Verify agent files have correct frontmatter (name, description, tools, color)
- Check that agent names match references in command files

### What You Get

Transform feature requests like *"Add user authentication"* into:
- âœ… Complete implementation with error handling
- âœ… TypeScript/lint error validation 
- âœ… Automated testing and quality checks
- âœ… Production-ready code documentation

## How It Works

This system uses 6 specialized AI agents working together:

1. **Context Gatherer** - Analyzes your codebase patterns
2. **Task Planner** - Creates detailed implementation roadmap  
3. **Implementation Agent** - Writes code with strict validation
4. **Quality Reviewer** - Verifies all quality gates pass
5. **Frontend Tester** - Validates UI/UX with automated tests
6. **Code Critic** - External unbiased quality assessment

## Usage

```bash
# Implement any feature
claude /task_complete "Add user authentication with JWT"

# Complete partial implementations
claude /task_finish "path/to/task/directory"
```

## Perfect For

### Large Codebases (500+ files)
- Maintains consistency across complex architectures
- Prevents breaking existing functionality

### TypeScript/React Projects  
- Specialized validation for TS errors
- Component pattern consistency

### High-Stakes Features
- Mission-critical functionality that MUST work
- Code that will be reviewed by senior developers

## Not Suitable For

- Simple one-file changes
- Quick prototypes/experiments
- Non-TypeScript projects (limited validation)

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code CLI ([install guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup))
- TypeScript project with lint/build commands
- 4GB+ RAM (for Claude Code)
- Anthropic account (Pro/Max plan recommended)

## Configuration

After installation, edit these files for your project:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Project overview and development commands
2. **.claude/agents/tc-frontend-tester.md** - Test credentials  
3. **.claude/agents/tc-codex-critic.md** - Technology stack

## Sample Output

Each task creates a timestamped directory with complete audit trail:

```
claude-tasks/2025-08-27-authentication/
â”œâ”€â”€ context.md              # Codebase analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ plan.md                 # Implementation roadmap  
â”œâ”€â”€ implementation-1.md     # Development log
â”œâ”€â”€ review-1.md            # Quality validation
â”œâ”€â”€ test-results.md        # UI/UX testing
â”œâ”€â”€ final-critique.md      # External assessment
â””â”€â”€ screenshots/           # Visual proof
```

## Advanced Configuration

For detailed setup and customization options, see:
- [**Setup Guide**](docs/SETUP.md) - Comprehensive configuration
- [**MCP Servers**](docs/MCP_SERVERS.md) - Required integrations
- [**Examples**](examples/) - Project-specific configurations

## Troubleshooting

**"MCP server not found"**
```bash
# Verify MCP servers installed
claude --check-mcp
```

**"Dev server won't start"**
```bash  
# Check your package.json scripts match CLAUDE.md configuration
npm run dev
```

**"Validation failed"**
```bash
# Run quality checks manually
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```

## Real-World Examples

**Before**: Ask Claude to "Add user authentication"
- Gets 50% complete then claims it's done
- Breaks existing TypeScript compilation  
- No error handling for edge cases
- Missing integration with existing routing

**After**: Same request with this system
- âœ… Complete JWT auth with refresh tokens
- âœ… Integrates with existing user management
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling & validation
- âœ… TypeScript errors fixed, lint warnings resolved
- âœ… Mobile-responsive login/signup forms tested
- âœ… Ready for production deployment
