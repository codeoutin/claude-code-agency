# Claude Code Task Completion System

A task chain system for automated feature implementation using Claude Code agents with comprehensive quality validation.

## 🚀 Personal Motivation

*From the creator:*

I've spent whole weekends coding huge tasks with AI. Starting with Chats (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini), to Cursor, to Claude Code. I ran often into the limitations of AI coding agents and I'm always trying to optimize my prompts.

With the introduction of Sub Agents and MCP servers, I finally found a workflow for complex tasks to have them implemented with a high quality standard that suits my projects.

These commands can run for hours and you will likely run into limitations if you are not on a Max Plan of Claude.

I share this workflow because I started out with publicly available agent descriptions, MCP server configurations and other information on GitHub and Reddit too and want to open this workflow for discussion and further improvements.

This command chain is using various MCP servers that are optional but highly recommended. My subscriptions are Claude on the 100 USD plan and ChatGPT on the 20 USD plan and I often run this command parallel to develop 3-4 features at once. I am using auto-accept to almost fully automate the process of development.

## 🎯 What This System Does

This is a **multi-agent orchestration system** that takes a feature request and delivers high quality, almost production-ready code through:

- **Automatic context gathering** from your codebase
- **Detailed implementation planning** with quality gates
- **Real-time development server monitoring** during implementation
- **Independent quality verification** with baseline regression analysis
- **Comprehensive frontend testing** using Playwright
- **External code critique** via Codex MCP for unbiased validation

## 🏆 Key Advantages

### ✅ **Actually Completes Tasks**
- **5-cycle implementation** with unlimited error-fixing via `/task_finish`
- **Baseline validation tracking** prevents regressions
- **Real-time dev monitoring** catches errors immediately
- **Independent verification** prevents false completion claims

### ✅ **Enterprise-Grade Quality**
- **Zero tolerance for regressions** - no new lint/TypeScript errors allowed
- **Multi-layer validation** with cross-verification between agents
- **Production-ready standards** with comprehensive testing
- **Automated quality gates** that must pass before completion

### ✅ **Complete Transparency**
- **Comprehensive audit trail** with all validation outputs
- **Progress tracking** with completion percentages
- **Screenshot evidence** of working features
- **External validation** through Codex critique

## 🎯 Perfect For

### **Large Codebases** (500+ files)
- Maintains consistency across complex architectures
- Prevents breaking existing functionality
- Handles intricate integration patterns

### **Enterprise Projects**
- Enforces professional code quality standards
- Comprehensive validation and testing
- Audit trails for compliance

### **TypeScript/React Projects**
- Specialized validation for TS error detection
- Component pattern consistency
- Build system integration

### **High-Stakes Features**
- Mission-critical functionality that MUST work
- Features that affect multiple systems
- Code that will be reviewed by senior developers

## ⚠️ When NOT to Use

### **Simple One-File Changes**
- Single function modifications
- Basic bug fixes in isolated files
- Documentation updates

### **Experimental/Prototype Code**
- Quick proof-of-concepts
- Throwaway experiments
- Code that doesn't need production quality

### **Non-TypeScript Projects**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code

# Install required development tools
npm install -D typescript eslint prettier
```

### 2. Set Up MCP Servers

This system requires several MCP servers. Add to your Claude Code configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "gpt-codex": {
      "url": "mcp://gpt-codex"
    },
    "playwright": {
      "url": "mcp://playwright"
    },
    "context7": {
      "url": "mcp://context7"
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "url": "mcp://sequential-thinking"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Copy Files to Your Project

```bash
# Copy commands
cp commands/*.md .claude/commands/

# Copy agents
cp agents/*.md .claude/agents/
```

### 4. Configure for Your Project

Edit the agent files to match your project:

- **tc-frontend-tester.md**: Update test credentials
- **tc-codex-critic.md**: Update technology stack description
- **task_complete.md**: Update build commands if needed

### 5. Run Your First Task

```bash
claude-code /task_complete "Add user authentication to login page"
```

## 📋 System Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning & Context (Steps 1-2)
1. **Context Gatherer** analyzes your codebase for relevant patterns
2. **Task Planner** creates detailed implementation roadmap

### Phase 2: Implementation Loop (Steps 3-4, up to 5 cycles)
3. **Dev Monitor** runs continuously, detecting runtime errors
4. **Implementation Agent** writes code with strict validation gates
5. **Quality Reviewer** independently verifies all claims

*Repeats until quality gates pass or 5 cycles reached*

### Phase 3: Final Validation (Steps 5-6)
6. **Frontend Tester** validates UI/UX with Playwright
7. **Codex Critic** provides external, unbiased quality assessment

## 🔧 Configuration Guide

### Build Commands
Update these in `commands/task_complete.md` for your project:

```bash
# Default commands
npm run lint          # Your linting command
npx tsc --noEmit      # TypeScript check
npm run build         # Production build
npm run dev           # Development server
```

### Test Credentials
Update in `agents/tc-frontend-tester.md`:

```markdown
**Primary Test Account:**
- Email: `your-test@email.com`
- Password: `your-test-password`
```

### Quality Standards
Customize validation rules in `agents/tc-quality-reviewer.md`:

- Acceptable error baselines
- Performance requirements
- Security standards

## 📊 Quality Gates

### **Baseline Validation**
- ✅ No new lint errors (current ≤ baseline)
- ✅ No new TypeScript errors (current ≤ baseline)
- ✅ Build succeeds without validation bypasses
- ✅ Dev server remains stable during implementation

### **Feature Completion**

- ✅ Integration with existing systems verified
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ✅ Manual testing scenarios pass

### **Production Readiness**

- ✅ Security patterns followed

## 🛠️ Commands

### `/task_complete "Feature description"`
Main command for feature implementation with 5-cycle limit.

**Example:**
```bash
/task_complete "Add real-time notifications with WebSocket support"
```

### `/task_finish "path/to/task/directory"`
Specialized command for finishing partially complete tasks with unlimited cycles.

**Example:**
```bash
/task_finish "claude-tasks/2025-08-26-15-30-45_add-notifications"
```

## 📁 Output Structure

Each task creates a timestamped directory:

```
